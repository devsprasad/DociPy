# This file is a sample for testing and understanding DociPy's 
# documentation capabilities. This comment will be considered
# as the documentation or description for the module sample1.py
# itself. And this whole comment will be rendered as a single line. 
# So styling need to be done accordingly to wrap the lines. But html
# tags can override the parsers and create a new line. For flexibility
# the parser and templating engines are separate. Also, a Python 
# script containing a custom parser and templating engine can be 
# presented to the tool. These will be loaded dynamically and appear 
# as a list on GUI.
