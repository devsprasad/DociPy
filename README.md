# DociPy
DociPy or * **Doc**umentor based on **I**ron**Py**thon* is a flexible .NET based tool for parsing python scripts and generate documentation for a Python project

## QuickStart 
Tool is GUI based and is pretty straight-forward to use. Simply add the project directory by clicking **Add Root** button. 
Follow the on-screen instructions. Tool will scan for all the python scripts in the project directory and files will be listed
in the listbox with relative paths. You can exclude some files from the list by removing them from the list. 
Use the property grid to configure the documentation engine which includes output directory, project title, version info etc.
Click GO to start processing. The exact directory structure of the project root will be created and html files will be created
for each of the script. Finally an index file will be created in the **Output Directory**
